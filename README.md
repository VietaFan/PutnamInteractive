# PutnamInteractive
Allows users to select sets of Putnam problems via the command-line, filtering by year, difficulty, and other characteristics, and creates LaTeX documents consisting of the desired problems.

To run the program, place the Putnam exam source files 1996.tex through 2016.tex from http://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/, as well as putnamData.txt, in the same directory as putnamInteractive.py and run with 'python putnamInteractive.py'. After the program starts, type 'help' for a list of possible commands. The command 'writepset' and 'openpset', which write the problemset to a LaTeX file and compile to PDF, and open the PDF file, respectively, require pdflatex to be installed on the system. 

The problems are ordered using three different metrics. The first, pctsolved, is the percentage of the top ~200 contestants scoring at least 8 points on the problem. The second, sloppiness, is the average number of points lost by contestants scoring between 8 and 10. The third, partial, is the average number of points scored by contestants scoring between 0 and 2 on the problem. This data is stored in putnamData.txt, which was compiled from http://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/putnam2016stats.html (and similar pages for other years).
