Find the smallest constant $C$ such that for every real polynomial $P(x)$ of degree 3 that has a root in the interval $[0,1]$,
\[
\int_0^1 \left| P(x) \right|\,dx \leq C \max_{x \in [0,1]} \left| P(x) \right|.
\]

\item[2016 A5]
Suppose that $G$ is a finite group generated by the two elements $g$ and $h$, where the order of $g$ is odd. Show that every element of $G$ can be written in the form
\[
g^{m_1} h^{n_1} g^{m_2} h^{n_2} \cdots g^{m_r} h^{n_r}
\]
with $1 \leq r \leq |G|$ and $m_1, n_1, m_2, n_2, \ldots, m_r, n_r \in \{-1, 1\}$. 
(Here $|G|$ is the number of elements of $G$.)

Find all functions $f$ from the interval $(1, \infty)$ to $(1, \infty)$ with the following property:
if $x,y \in (1, \infty)$ and $x^2 \leq y \leq x^3$, then $(f(x))^2 \leq f(y) \leq (f(x))^3$.

\item[2015 B6]
For each positive integer $k$, let $A(k)$ be the number of odd divisors of $k$ in the interval $[1, \sqrt{2k})$. Evaluate
\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k-1} \frac{A(k)}{k}.
\]

\item[2007 A--1]
Find all values of $\alpha$ for which the curves $y = \alpha x^2 +
\alpha x + \frac{1}{24}$ and $x = \alpha y^2 + \alpha y + \frac{1}{24}$
are tangent to each other.

A game involves jumping to the right on the real number line. If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers
and $b > a$, the cost of jumping from $a$ to $b$ is $b^3-ab^2$. For what real numbers
$c$ can one travel from $0$ to $1$ in a finite number of jumps with total cost exactly $c$?

Let $A$ be a positive real number.  What are the possible values of
$\sum_{j=0}^\infty x_j^2$, given that $x_0,x_1,\ldots$ are positive
numbers
for which $\sum_{j=0}^\infty x_j=A$?

\item[2002 A--5]
Define a sequence by $a_0=1$, together with the rules
$a_{2n+1} = a_n$ and $a_{2n+2} = a_n + a_{n+1}$ for each
integer $n \geq 0$. Prove that every positive rational number
appears in the set
\[
\left\{ \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}: n \geq 1 \right\} =
\left\{ \frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{1}, \frac{1}{3},
\frac{3}{2}, \dots \right\}.

\item[2003 B--1]
Do there exist polynomials  $a(x), b(x), c(y), d(y)$  such that
\[
       1 + x y + x^2 y^2 = a(x) c(y) + b(x) d(y)
\]
holds identically?
